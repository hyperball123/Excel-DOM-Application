## overflow - if we set height or width and content is more than the set size it will overflow. 
    
There are properties for overflow u can use auto for scroll bars and many more 

------------------
## position 
if we set postion relative for the parent 
starting point for the children will be from the start of parent space on the page

for example in this project we set grid container to relative and 
using absolute on its childrens so the starting point for the children will be (0,0) which is left corner of the page where grid container starts.
